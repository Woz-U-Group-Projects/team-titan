Title: BugTracker1000

Summary of project: We are creating a bug tracking system. This system is enhanced with crud operation. We want the user to be able to Create bug tickets, Have the ability to update then as needed, as well as delete them. In addition the user will also be able to tag or assign bugs to developers or the people involved in the resolution of the issue. The ability to give the bug a status of open, or closed will be added as well.

Justification: By creating a bug tracking system we will not only he helping the software development community by providing an excellent platform  to track issues within the code. We will also be stretching our talents and ambitions by utilizing helpful frameworks such as  Angular. Utilizing the CRUD operations we will challenge our  skills by sending messages to a developer and editing the tracking and removing tickets that are no longer necessary.
